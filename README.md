  <p>This Extension will make YouTube Shorts more controllable for you. It gives you the ability to seek in the video, skip to whatever time you want. Also adds a optional Auto-Scroll Feature, which automatically plays the next Shorts Video for you. Also you can finally turn down the Volume with that Add-On. You'll also be able to see the Shorts Upload-Date and Views-Count.</p>
